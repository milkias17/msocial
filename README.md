# MSocial

A very basic social media site.

## Why

To learn how to handle the backend of a website and learning things like user authentication, session management and etc.

## You could have improved ...

This was not a project meant to be used by anyone so there are a lot of things that can be optimized and some features that should have been implemented.
But this was just a project to learn on so I didn't spend more time than I needed to and just implemented the features in the simplest way.

## How do I try it out

There is a sample database with a few users! But make sure you have python and pip installed and in your PATH.

1. Go to the project root.
2. ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. ```bash
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   export FLASK_APP=msocial
   ```
4. ```bash
   flask run
   ```
